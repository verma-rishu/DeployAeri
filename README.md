### How would you explain Vercel in one line? 
It takes link to your github project and deploy it on the internet. Making developers like quite easy, right?

Well yes, vercel does that but this vercel-clone doesn't. In this one we only take care of the gist of Vercel like only deploying lightweight projects.
